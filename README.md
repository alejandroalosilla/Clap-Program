# Clap Program
 Clap Program is a simple program created by me that emits applause sounds. The focus itself is to see the operation of a simple algorithm in Python working in a simple graphical interface also turning into an executable file (.exe).

 --> If you are going to download the executable program, be sure to place the "ClapProgram.exe" in the same folder as the audio file "clap_sound.mp3" for perfect execution.
